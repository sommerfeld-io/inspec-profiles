# AI Prompt

Create a clean, modern illustration representing a collection of Chef InSpec profiles used for automated infrastructure security and compliance testing, without using any text or logos. Center the design around a shield icon with a checkmark or tick, symbolizing security and validated compliance.

From the shield, draw four outward-pointing arrows leading to abstract icons representing different types of infrastructure being tested:

- A container (cubical block with subtle modular detail),
- A workstation node (flat monitor or terminal-like shape),
- A server node (stacked rectangular blocks),
- A Raspberry Pi node (compact board-like shape with GPIO-style lines or small footprint features).

Each target system should be distinct in form but cohesive in style and proportion, communicating variety in the infrastructure while maintaining visual consistency.

Add a single incoming arrow pointing to the shield, leading from an icon symbolizing test definitions as code—such as a stylized document with gears, brackets, or code lines. This incoming arrow represents the flow of InSpec profile code powering the validation logic.

Arrange all elements in a symmetrical and visually balanced layout, with the shield at the center. Use abstract arrows and connectors to suggest dynamic scanning and validation, without visual clutter.

Use a transparent background.

- Fill all infrastructure icons and the shield with #1E2129.
- Use #5e8bde for outlines, arrows, and connectors.
- Apply #ff6e42 sparingly as subtle highlights on the shield, checkmark, or edge details.
- Outlines and borders should maintain contrast but not appear too bright—aim for a clean, understated finish.

The visual style should be flat or subtly dimensional, suitable for use on a documentation landing page. Avoid any branded symbols—do not use Chef or platform logos. The focus should be on conveying automated, code-driven security compliance applied across a range of modern infrastructure components.
